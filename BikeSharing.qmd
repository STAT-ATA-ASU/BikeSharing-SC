# Introduction

This is an exploration of bicycle-sharing data in the city of Seattle, WA (USA) from **October 2014 - April 2015** not the data Amber used that was **October 2014 - August 2016**. I hope to eventually combine this data with other forms of ride-sharing and transportation in the city, but this will be the first step.

Time to get started!

```{r}
#| label: "setup"
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = NA, fig.align = "center")
```

## Loading Necessary Packages

```{r}
#| label: "needed"
# For data manipulation and tidying
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)

# For mapping
library(ggmap)
library(mapproj)

# For data visualizations
library(ggplot2)

# For modeling and machine learning
library(caret)
```

## Importing Data

All of the data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset). This project contains 3 data sets and each file is imported and inspected independently using the `read.csv()` function.

:::{.callout-warning}
The data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset) is not the same data that was originally analyzed by Amber.  Specifically, the number of rows in the `trip` dataset downloaded from Kaggle is 50,793 compared to the 236,065 rows Amber analyzes.  The Pronto web site for Seattle is no longer available.

```{r}
station <- read.csv(file = "./data/station.csv",
                    header = TRUE,
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

trip <- read.csv(file = "./data/trip.csv",
                 header = TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

weather <- read.csv(file = "./data/weather.csv",
                    header = TRUE,
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Ok, let's take a look at each of these data files.

### Data Structures and Variables

#### `station`

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(station)
```

There are 9 variables in the data `station` data frame:

1. `station_id`: The individual ID number for a bike station

2. `name`: The name of that station ID, also appears to be the rough location of the station

3. `lat`: The latitude of the station

4. `long`: The longitude of the station

5. `install_date`: Date that station was placed in service (MM/DD/YYYY format)

6. `install_dockcount`: Number of docks (bike positions) at each station on the installation date

7. `modification_date`: Date that station was modified, resulting in a change in location or dock count (MM/DD/YYYY format)

8. `current_dockcount`: Number of docks at each station on 8/31/2016

9. `decommission_date`: Date that station was placed out of service (MM/DD/YYYY format)

#### `trip`
